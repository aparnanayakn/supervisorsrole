                      good supervision is characterised by trusting relationships where students and
supervisors share research interests and supervisors provide advice without undermining
students’ ownership of projects, resulting in evolving supportive relationships that foster
student growth.

						<ul> 					 
								<li>Differing expectations</li>
								<li>Lack of support</li>
								<li>Lack of interst and ownership</li>
								<li> Relationships that don't evolve</li>
								<li> Personality conflicts</li>
								<li>Overworked and pressuered to publish</li>

					<h3>What Each Role Involves?</h3>
                    <p>
						<ul> 					 
							<li><b> Subject Expert: </b> The supervisor acts as  
								an expert in the relevant academic field. 
								They help students understand 
								complex concepts, and ensure the project aligns 
								with current developments in the discipline.
							</li>
							<li> <b>Gatekeeper of academic standards:</b> Supervisor uphold the academic integrity 
								and quality of the student's work. They ensure that the project/dissertation meets
							instituational and disciplinary standards, including proper referencing, and 
						ethical compliance. </li>
							<li> <b>Resource person and Advisor of literature:</b> Supervisors
							guide students in identifying, accessing and critically engaging with relevant literature. 
						They help students by recommending key readings, and support the development of a 
					strong theoretical and conceptual framework.</li>
							<li> <b>Project manager: </b> Supervisor helps the student plan and manage their 
							time effectively. They assist in setting milestones, monitoring progress, and
						ensuring the project stays on track for timely completion.</li>
							<li> <b> Shaper: </b> Supervisors help shape the direction and scope of the project. 
							They encourage critical thinking and support the student in developing a well-structured and 
							academically sound solution. </li>
							<li> <b>Scaffolder and supporter: </b> Supervisor offer encouragement, help overcome obstacles, 
								and build the students confidence in their abilities.</li>
							<li> <b> Editor: </b> Supervisors provide feedback on strucure, clarity, and academic
								 style. They help students improve the quality of their writing and presentation.</li>
							<li> <b>Promoter of student self-efficacy:</b> Supervisors encourage students to 
								develop confidence in their ability to successfully complete the project.</li>
					</ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>While the responsibilities remain consistent, 
					different universities may use varying terminology to describe them.
					 For example, <a href="https://www.ugent.be/en/work/mobility-career/career-aspects/professorial-staff/supportive-program/rolesphdsupervisor/leadershiprolessupervisor.htm"> Ghent University </a>
					uses the terminologies leader, manager, coach, entrepreneur, and expert.
					Overall, supervisors play a crucial role in shaping the quality and 
					success of student projects and dissertations, 
					while also promoting the development of confidence and competency in students.

						<h3><a href="#">Your role</a></h3>
                        <p>

							A supervisor's role evolves continuously to meet the changing needs of 
							the student. The above images depicts a student driving a vehicle with different
							degrees of supervisor participation. Students bring a variety of personalities 
							and expectactions to the process - some eager and driven, others anxious or uncertain, 
							and while others somewhere in between. Hence, supervision can be considered as a dynamic
							process in which students might require close supervion in the beginning, eventually 
							the supervisor’s role changes enabling students to take responsibility for their work.
							Ultimately, effective supervision involves knowing when to step in, when to back off, 
							and how to help students become confident, self-sufficient learners.
