                    <p>

                      Formal training in supervision is rarely included in standard teacher 
                      education curriculum. As a result, most supervisors do not receive 
                      structured preparation for this role. Consequently, many people draw from their
                       personal experiences as former students, frequently modelling their supervisory 
                       approach after how they were supervised. Hence, every supervisor creates a
                       unique and frequently informal model of supervision that is influenced by 
                       personal beliefs, prior experiences, and environmental circumstances
                        (Roberts & Seaman (2018), Qureshi & Vazir (2016)). Supervision can be understood as a form of 
                        pedagogy - a reflective process 
                      that supports student learning and development beyond traditional instruction.
                       It is far more than an administrative  or evaluative task; serves as a crucial
                       educational role in supporting students as they navigate the intellectual,
                       emotional, and interpersonal  challenges of their academic experience. 
                       Viewing supervision as pedagogy highlights its role 
                       in shaping empowered learners within growth-oriented educational settings.

                    <h3>The pedagogical skills</h3>

                  <p> Burns, R. W., & Badiali, B. (2016) have identified key 
                   pedagogical skills in clinical supersion. However, these skills might be
                  required for every supervisor as it helps to achieve 
                effective supervion. </p>

                    <h3>The key pedagogial skills include: </h3>
                    <p>
                      <ol>
                        <li><b>Noticing:</b> This is the ability to distinguish certain 
                          incidents from others in practice, i.e. identifying a critical incident.
                          When noticed, supervisors can share it either verbally or in writing. 
                          
                          <ul>
                            <li>Physical marking</li>
                            <li>Mental marking</li>
                            <li>Disclosure</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><b> Ignoring: </b>This skill involves the intentional selection 
                          of inaction regarding a critical incident that was noticed. 
                          It is the deliberate choice not to act despite knowing something is occurring</li>
                        <li><b>Intervening: </b> This is taking action as a result of a critical incident. 
                          It typically involves stepping in to 
                          support the teacher candidate or the students during instruction.</li>
                        <li><b>Pointing: </b> This makes the critical incident and the
                           supervisor's perspective visible to the other person either physically or verbally.</li>
                        <li><b>Unpacking: </b> This skill breaks down a complex critical incident into simpler components,
                          involving reflectivity to help the novice make meaning from the experience.
                          <ul>
                            <li>Supervisor-centered unpacking</li>
                            <li>Supervisor-facilitated unpacking</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Processing: </b>  This involves reflecting on the critical incident through 
                          conversation with the novice to understand it and decide upon next steps.
                          <ul>
                            <li>Supervisor-centered processing</li>
                            <li>Supervisor-facilitated processing</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                      </ol>
                      These pedagogical skills highlight the teaching dimension of supervision, 
                      moving beyond a simplistic view of supervisors as detached observers.
