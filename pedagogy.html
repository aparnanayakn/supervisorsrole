                      Formal training in supervision is rarely included in standard teacher 
                      education curriculum. As a result, most supervisors do not receive 
                      structured preparation for this role. Consequently, many people draw from their
                       personal experiences as former students, frequently modelling their supervisory 
                       approach after how they were supervised. Hence, every supervisor creates a
                       unique and frequently informal model of supervision that is influenced by 
                       personal beliefs, prior experiences, and environmental circumstances.   
                      Supervision can be understood as a form of  pedadogy - a reflective process 
                      that supports student learning and development beyond traditional instruction.
                       It is far more than an administrative  or evaluative task; serves as a crucial
                       educational role in supporting students as they navigate the intellectual,
                       emotional, and interpersonal  challenges of their academic experience. 
                       Viewing supervion as pedagogy highlights its role 
                       in shaping empowered learners within growth-oriented educational setting.

                    <p>While the responsibilities remain consistent, 
					different universities may use varying terminology to describe them.
					 For example, <a href="https://www.ugent.be/en/work/mobility-career/career-aspects/professorial-staff/supportive-program/rolesphdsupervisor/leadershiprolessupervisor.htm"> Ghent University </a>
					uses the terminologies leader, manager, coach, entrepreneur, and expert.
					Overall, supervisors play a crucial role in shaping the quality and 
					success of student projects and dissertations, 
					while also promoting the development of confidence and competency in students.
